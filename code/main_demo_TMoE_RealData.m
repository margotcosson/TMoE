% >>t mixture of experts (TMoE): Robust mixtures-of-experts modeling using the t distribution <<
%
% TMoE : A Matlab/Octave toolbox for modeling, sampling, inference, regression and clustering of
% heterogeneous data with the t Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) model.
%
% TMoE provides a flexible and robust modeling framework for heterogenous data with possibly
% heavy-tailed distributions and corrupted by atypical observations. TMoE consists of a mixture of K
% t expert regressors network (of degree p) gated by a softmax gating network (with regression
% degree q) and is represented by
% - The gating net. parameters $\alpha$'s of the softmax net.
% - The experts network parameters: The location parameters (regression coefficients) $\beta$'s,
% scale parameters $\sigma$'s, and the degree of freedom (robustness) parameters $\nu$'s.
%
% TMoE thus generalises  mixtures of (normal, t, and) distributions and mixtures of regressions with
% these distributions. For example, when $q=0$, we retrieve mixtures of (t-, or normal) regressions,
% and when both $p=0$ and $q=0$, it is a mixture of (t-, or normal) distributions. It also reduces
% to the standard (normal, t) distribution when we only use a single expert (K=1).
%
% Model estimation/learning is performed by a dedicated expectation conditional maximization (ECM)
% algorithm by maximizing the observed data log-likelihood. We provide simulated examples to
% illustrate the use of the model in model-based clustering of heterogeneous regression data and in
% fitting non-linear regression functions. Real-world data examples of tone perception for musical
% data analysis, and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate change data, are
% also provided as application of the model.
%
% To run it on the provided examples, please run "main_demo_TMoE_SimulatedData.m" or
% "main_demo_TMoE_RealData.m"
